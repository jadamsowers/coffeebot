# Coffeebot

Coffeebot is an internet connected coffee timer that lets your office know when coffee has been made. The project uses a Particle Photon processor to drive an LCD that contains the time that the last coffee was brewed and send events to Slack via [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). The hardware is basically an internet-connected LCD with four buttons, and can be used for many uses outside of coffee.
